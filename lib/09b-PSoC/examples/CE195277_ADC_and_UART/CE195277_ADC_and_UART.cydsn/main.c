* Function Name: main
********************************************************************************
*
* Summary:
*  main() performs following functions:
*  1: Starts the ADC and UART components.
*  2: Checks for ADC end of conversion.  Stores latest result in output
*     if conversion complete.
*  3: Checks for UART input.
*     On 'C' or 'c' received: transmits the last sample via the UART.
*     On 'S' or 's' received: continuously transmits samples as they are completed.
*     On 'X' or 'x' received: stops continuously transmitting samples.
*     On 'E' or 'e' received: transmits a dummy byte of data.
*
* Parameters:
*  None.
*
* Return:
*  None.
