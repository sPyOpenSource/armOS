uCdl v1.0
=========

This is a libdl-like library for uClinux. Read the header
file to see the 4-function API.

The only catch: uClinux uses BFLT binaries, which include no symbol
table; as such, you have to make one yourself. After elf2flt, run

  nm yourapp.gdb | grep ' T ' | symadd yourapp

Example: copy modtest, modtest.sym, and testmod.o to your iPod.
         Run modtest. You should see about seven P's and the text
         "All tests passed." This tests access of variables and
         functions across module boundaries.

To compile, type `make'. You may or may not want to put symadd in
your PATH.

To link with it, put libuCdl.a and ucdl.h in your program directory and
specify libuCdl.a on the link line.

Enjoy. MIT license.
