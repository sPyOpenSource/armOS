This is ttk, a GUI (and other stuff) toolkit for the iPod.

Overview
--------
See API/API.pdf for a probably up-to-date documentation of the API.
You can regenerate it from the LaTeX source API/API.tex with
`make docs'.

Everything is done now except the COP functions, which arguably
shouldn't be in a graphics library.

To compile the library, just type `make'. To install it,
`sudo make install'. To compile the examples, `make examples'.

The examples are build/*/ex*, built with `make examples'.
They are:
* exscroll - see below
* exmenu - demonstration of the menu, slider, and textarea widgets
* eximage - demonstration of the image viewer widget (must be run
            with one argument, the image to show)
* exti - a text input demonstration for desktop only.

In order to run TTK apps on your iPod, you'll need to copy
the binary to /mnt/ipod/bin/ and copy the `fonts/' directory
in this archive to /mnt/ipod/usr/share/fonts. The fonts.lst
format is like the one used by Podzilla's font.lst, except
that the [filename] field is missing the extension. (This allows
different fonts to be used for different iPods, e.g. using an
anti-aliased font on the Photo). This small difference is the
reason for the slight name change. See section 6.2 of the API
reference for details.

Four versions of the library are built: ipod-sdl, ipod-mwin,
x11-sdl, x11-mwin. Be sure to link with the appropriate one.

Compilation
-----------
Use the output of
`ttk-config --[ipod|x11] --[mwin|sdl] --[cflags|libs|(both)]`.
Most necessary libraries are linked into libttk on the iPod.

exscroll
--------
exscroll is a quickie demo program for TTK. The interface
consists of two numbers. I'll call them #1 (top) and #2 (bottom).

 * Scrolling left or right changes #1 by that amount.
 * Tapping the scroll wheel sets #2 to that position.
 * << or >> decreases or increases (resp.) #1 by 10.
 * Menu exits.
 * Play resets #1 and #2 to 0.
 * Action sets #2 to 100.
 * #2 is reset to 0 every three seconds.

This demonstrates most of the base functionality of the TTK GUI.
Widgets can respond to all of this.

A few heuristics are used to avoid counting scrolling or button
pressing as a scrollwheel tap or vice versa, but the cost of this
is that scrollwheel taps cannot be detected until you take your
finger off the wheel.

Have a lot of fun!
