\chapter{Architecture}
{\bf Podzilla~2 is a modular user interface for the iPod based on TTK.}

\noindent You're probably reading this document because you want to write a module
for Podzilla 2, which will be abbreviated \pzt\ in this manual. Fear not; it's not all that
hard. You should be thoroughly familiar with
TTK\footnote{API reference at http://www.get-linux.org/$\sim$oremanj/t/ttk-api.pdf.} and C
programming in general, though, before you start. This chapter will cover the concepts used
in the library, and how it integrates with TTK. The actual function call documentation will
come later.

\section{Structure}
\pzt\ is mostly a collection of smaller APIs, each dedicated to handling one particular thing:
modules, configuration, menu handling, nicer wrappers around the TTK GUI model, putting things
in the header, dialog boxes, vector text, iPod hardware functions, font handling, DSP simplifying
functions, adding actions for the file browser, handling text input, and hooking various global
events --- in fact, that's the complete list (for now). In general, these APIs rarely interact
with each other, and you can use as many or as few of their facilities as you wish.

\section{Interaction with TTK}
{\bf You never have to use \pzt\ wrappers when you want to call TTK directly.} Functions like
\verb|pz_*_window| are provided as a {\it simplification}; you are free to use them or not,
as you wish. This manual will generally give examples of the \pz\ calls, since it is assumed
that the reader is already familiar with the TTK ones; but always remember the TTK calls will
work just as well. A \verb|PzWindow| is a \verb|TWindow|, and a \verb|PzWidget| is a \verb|TWidget|;
the synonyms have been introduced solely for consistency.

\section{Modules}
Modules are used to implement practically everything useful in \pzt; as such, their structure
is highly flexible. Modules are {\it not} tied to one particular menu item or even one particular
application; a loaded module is basically just an extension of the \pz\ core.

Modules consist of four things: a {\sl module description file}, the {\sl code}, optional {\sl data
files}, and an optional {\sl configuration description}. The module description file,
a simple ASCII text file named \verb|Module|, contains
metadata about the module: name, author, dependencies, etc.; its format is as described in
section \ref{moddesc}. The code is compiled into an object file for loading with the dynamic
loader for iPodLinux (uCdl).
The data files can be whatever you want.

The configuration description is used to allow the user to select compile-time options for your
module, with an interface very similar to the Linux kernel configurator. If you do not provide
one---and you don't need to, unless your module has special needs---a sensible default will be
used (one option specifying whether the module should be compiled in, made as a module, or
not compiled at all).

Every module must have a {\it unique} ``shortname'', which is the only one ever used programmatically.
The shortname should be all lowercase letters, with no spaces. It is used in pathnames,
function calls, etc. However, since shortnames aren't pretty, every module also defines a
{\sl display name}, which will be the one used in the interface. Display names won't cause quite
so much mayhem in the event of a clash, but you should still try to keep them unique. We eventually
plan to set up a central database of what names are taken, to prevent clashing.

All this is put into a \verb|pod| file, basically a type of archive formatted so it can be
mounted like a filesystem. The creation of the \verb|pod| file is handled by the build system.
That \verb|pod| file then goes into \verb|/usr/lib| on your iPod, or you can simply copy a directory
with all the files in it.
However the data is stored, the module sees it as a plain old file---no fancy calls are needed
to read your data. {\bf Since all data can be easily handled inside the module's \verb|pod| file, there
is no reason modules need to litter other parts of the filesystem with their data, and this
is thus highly discouraged.}

When a module is loaded, its init function is called. That's it. No other functions are ever
directly called from the module, save those you set as handlers for something. If you want
to create a menu item, your init function has to handle that; if you want to have a cleanup
function called, your init function has to arrange for that; etc. You declare the name of
your init function by writing \verb|PZ_MOD_INIT(name_of_init_function)| near the end of your
file, outside any function. The init function takes no arguments and returns none; it can do
whatever it wants.

If you want to access data or configuration, you'll need to save a pointer to the \verb|PzModule|
structure associated with your module; this is obtained by calling \verb|pz_register_module()|.
If you want a cleanup function, you also pass it to \verb|pz_register_module()|. This module
structure should probably be saved in a static global variable; it can be used later to get
paths to your data and to your configuration area.

A word about globals scoping: {\bf make all functions and global variables in your module
\verb|static| unless you need them accessible by other modules.}
uCdl has rather unique name resolution semantics: it searches first the \pz\ core, then each
module loaded in turn, for any unresolved symbols. Once it finds one, it does not keep searching
more modules; thus, you will only ever get ``multiply defined'' errors if the symbol is multiply
defined in the {\it same module}. However, it is still advisable to avoid global namespace pollution,
so make everything you can \verb|static|. Unlike the Linux kernel, we don't have a nice
way of enforcing that by default.

Modules can depend on other modules unconditionally by listing them in the {\tt Dependencies:} line
in the \verb|Module| file, and use these modules' symbols just by prototyping them. Also, you
can depend {\it conditionally} on another module's symbols---for instance, not failing to load if that
module doesn't exist---with a call to \verb|pz_module_softdep()|. You pass the module and the symbol
you're looking for; it returns the symbol (function, variable) if it finds it, or \verb|NULL| if
it doesn't (or the module's not loaded).

\section{Dealing with Legacy Applications}
The porting of legacy applications from legacy podzilla is extraordinarily simple. First, add the
line
\begin{verbatim}
#define PZ_COMPAT
\end{verbatim}
just before \verb|#include|ing \verb|"pz.h"|; second, add a module init function that calls
\verb|pz_menu_add_legacy()|. To simplify this for the simple cases, you can just do
\begin{verbatim}
PZ_SIMPLE_MOD("thing", new_thing_window, "/Extras/Stuff/Thing")
\end{verbatim}
instead of
\begin{verbatim}
static void init_thing() {
    pz_menu_add_legacy ("/Extras/Stuff/Thing", new_thing_window);
}
PZ_MOD_INIT(init_thing)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Configurations}
{\bf Every module keeps its own configuration.} The previous podzilla settings system of
ID $\to$ Value mappings has been kept, extended, and opened to modules. To set a setting
for podzilla globally, you now do \verb|pz_set_TYPE_setting (pz_global_settings, setting_id, value)|,
but you don't use the global settings file for module-specific configuration. Modules keep
their own configurations, in a file in the directory \verb|/etc/podzilla/|\hskip0pt\verb|modules/NAME|. You
get a path to this directory with \verb|pz_module_get_cfgpath()| and then use \verb|pz_load_config()|
and friends to work with the configuration.

Config files now support six types of settings.
\begin{description}
\item[Integer] settings are the most common, holding simply a 32-bit integer.
\item[String] settings hold---you guessed it---a NUL-terminated string.
\item[Float] settings hold a double-precision floating-point value.
\item[Int list] settings hold a variable-length array of integers.
\item[String list] settings hold a variable-length array of strings.
\item[Blob] settings hold arbitrary binary data.
\end{description}
Each setting is uniquely identified with a {\sl setting ID}, which is just an integer that
you'll probably want to \verb|#define| to something meaningful. Setting IDs must be unique
between different settings; chaos will probably ensue if they are not.

An external utility called \verb|pzconf| allows you to examine and modify the contents of
\pzt\ configuration files. See its documentation for details.

\section{Main Menu}
\pzt\ handles items in the main menu with a directory structure. (The ``main menu'' consists
of the actual top-level menu, plus all its children that are also unmodified menus, all their
children, etc.) A menu item is identified by a string like \verb|/Extras/Games/MyGame|, which
refers to ``MyGame'' in the ``Games'' menu of the ``Extras'' menu of the top-level menu.
Whenever you add a menu item whose parents don't exist, they will be created. Basically, all
you need to worry about is the leaf nodes; the submenus will sort themselves out.

The podzilla menu handler takes no arguments and returns a \verb|PzWindow*|. You can add items with
normal TTK handlers as well (which take an argument indicating the menu item that was
selected)---\verb|pz_menu_add_ttkh()| will let you do that. You can also add items that change
a setting or select from a list of choices. If you want your menu handler to do something
other than return a window to be shown onscreen, you can return one of the \verb|TTK_MENU_*| directives
from TTK.

\section{GUI Simplification Layer}
\pzt\ has a few functions to make TTK programming easier for very simple widgets.
Remember, {\bf you don't have to use them if you don't want to}.
\verb|pz_do_window()| is perhaps the simplest one---you provide a name, geometry, and
draw and event handlers, and it returns a ready-made window, combining all the steps below.

Otherwise, you call \verb|pz_new_window()| with arguments indicating the geometry of the
window you want---\verb|PZ_WINDOW_NORMAL| for a fullscreen window with header,
\verb|PZ_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN| for a really-fullscreen one without header, \verb|PZ_WINDOW_POPUP|
for a centered window exactly big enough for what you put in it, and \verb|PZ_WINDOW_XYWH|
to specify dimensions yourself. Then, you add widgets to it with \verb|pz_add_widget| or
\verb|ttk_add_widget|; the ``widgets'' dealt with by \verb|pz_add_widget| are constructed
simply by giving a draw callback and an event handler function. If you want a timer,
you set that on the returned widget with \verb|pz_widget_set_timer|.

Events, unlike in pure TTK, are handled with one handler function, as this is simpler in
the simple case of not handling a lot of events. The event handler is passed a \verb|PzEvent|
structure containing four things: \verb|wid| (a pointer to the widget that received the event);
\verb|type| (one of the \verb|PZ_EVENT_*| constants); \verb|arg| (the button pressed, distance
scrolled, etc.); and \verb|time| (valid for button-release events: the time the button had been
pressed).

When you are done with a window, you should call \verb|pz_hide_window()| or \verb|pz_close_window()|,
depending on whether it should be cached for the next time it is selected from a menu.
\verb|pz_hide_window()| will keep all data structures of the window allocated and simply hide
it offscreen, whereas \verb|pz_close_window()| will cause everything to be freed and the window
to be recreated anew next time it is selected.

\section{Header Widgets}

There are a few functions for interacting with the header widget
and header decorations system.

Widgets can be on the left side, on the right side, or both.  Each
widget has an independant setting for the rate at which 
it is to be updated.  At this interval, the widget's \verb|update_fcn|
is called.  For a prototype of this, refer to the pz.h file, or an
example which can be found in the header clock module.  This function
can be a \verb|NULL| pointer as well, in which case, no update
function is to be called.  If the user deems that the widget is to
appear on both the left and right side of the header, then the
update time on the left side will be observed.  Generally, it is
within this function that the widget will change its width to be
appropriate for the amount of space necessary to display its content.

The widet's width is stored in the ``widg'' structure, passed in
via the header info structure.  \verb|hdrinfo->widg->w| If you want
a square widget (the default size) fill \verb|w| with the content
of the widget's height \verb|hdrinfo->widg->h|.  When you instantiate
a new widget, its default width is 0 pixels.  If you want it to
appear, you need to set this to a positive width in pixels.

If you set the width to be zero (0), then the header widget management
system will behave as though there is no widget.  That is to say
that if there are two widgets active on one side, with the display
mode to be ``cycle'', then it will alternate between the two widgets.
If one of them has a width of 0, then only one widget will display.
Both widgets' update functions will get called though.

When the system deems that the widget needs to be redrawn, either
when a header redraw happens, the epoch changes, whatever, then the
widget's \verb|draw_fcn| will be called.  The wiget must draw on the 
passed in surface in the region defined in \verb|hdrinfo->widg|.  No
clipping will happen.  The widget should observe all of the boundaries
within that structure while drawing its content.

Likewise, decorations have similar qualities.  Decorations are
updated at a constant once-per-second.  This is not configurable.
Decorations are generally expected to draw outside of their bounding
area, defined by the x position and the w of the widg.  Generally,
a decoration will fill the entire header area, which is defined as
\verb|0,0| thru \verb|ttk screen->w,hdrinfo->widg->h|.  The region
defined by the widg's x and w describes the center area of the
header bar, between the left and right widget sets.

It should be noted that the text is rendered by the ttk system, not
within your decoration draw routine.  The ttk system observes the
justification of the text (left, right, center).  You can hint to
it that you want to adjust the left and right boundaries using the
\verb|pz_header_justification_helper| function.  This will adjust
the left and right boundaries to be whatever you like.  Look at
core/header.c for how to force the justification to be a specific
setting.

Header widgets and header decorations are to be registered to the
system using the \verb|pz_add_header_widget| and
\verb|pz_add_header_decoration| functions, respectively.  The
\verb|data| pointer passed in is preserved in the header info
structure which is passed to your callback functions.
The Display Names passed in define what name it goes by for the 
settings menu, as well as the configuration file when settings are
saved out.

Some other helpful functions are as follows;

\verb|find_header_info| will retrieve an item based on its registered name.

\verb|pz_enable_widget_on_side| forces a widget to appear on a side.

\verb|pz_header_widget_set_rate| sets the rate in milliseconds that
the update function will get called. NOTE, that some versions might
not observe this exactly.  3300ms might result in a 2000ms update
rate, since early versions support rates of 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30,
and 60 seconds.  This call will pick the most appropriate value
without going over.

\verb|pz_enable_header_decorations| likewise switches to a decoration.

\verb|pz_force_update_of_widget| finds and calls a widget's update
function.  This is used for example, when the hold switch is flipped,
to force an immediate update of the hold icon indicator.

\verb|pz_clear_header_lists| should be use to wipe out the internal lists.

\verb|pz_header_settings_load| forces an update of the system header settings from the preferences file.


\subsection{Transient Widgets}

Transient Widgets are those that a module, a game for example, might
want to enable while the game is running, then remove from the
header on exit.  For the sake of this explanation, I will assume
that it is a status or score indicator for a game. There are two
ways to accomplish this.  The first is using the above mechanisms,
add in a standard widget, and simply set its width to ``0'' while
it's not in use.  

The more appropriate way to go is to set up a header group when
your game starts, and remove it when the game exits.  To do this,
you make a call to \verb|pz_header_group_create|.  This will return
a group number, the identifier for the group you just created.  When
you want to get rid of the widgets as your game exits back to the
menu system, call \verb|pz_header_group_destroy| to remove all
references of your group from the system.  This will automatically
activate the previous group, that is to say, it will reactivate
\verb|(your new group)-1|

You can manually activate and deactivate header widget groups using
the \verb|pz_header_group_activate| and \verb|pz_header_group_deactivate|
functions respectively.  Activate will not deactivate any other groups.

Group zero (0) is always the standard core widgets.  You cannot
destroy this group, but you can manually reactivate it while your
game is paused, or whenever you like.

Header groups are exclusive.  A widget can only be in one group, and
only one group can be displayed at any time.  A group consists of 
widgets on the left as well as those on the right.  Use the above 
\verb|pz_enable_widget_on_side| and \verb|pz_header_widget_set_rate| to
control location and update speed for your added widgets.

You need to add widgets with the \verb|pz_header_group_add_widget|
function, rather than the above function, so that you can specify
the group number you're adding your widget into.

\section{Vector Text}
Since many games and such need text at any number of sizes, and scalable fonts are impractical
on the iPod, a vector text engine was developed. The text engine can print strings containing
most ASCII characters, with the exception that lowercase characters are printed as capitals,
with only straight lines; as such, they are feasible at absolutely any size.

When drawing vector text, you need to specify a few parameters: \verb|cw|, \verb|ch|, and
\verb|kern|. \verb|cw| and \verb|ch| control the size of each individual character:
the characters will be \verb|cw| pixels wide and \verb|ch| pixels tall. (All characters
are the same width and height; the legacy podzilla vectorfont code used a base size of
$5\times9$.)

\verb|kern| supplies a value by which to {\it change} the kerning of the characters.
By default, characters are kerned by one pixel, plus one pixel per eight pixels of width.
The \verb|kern| parameter is added to this default kerning, so it can extend or negate it.
For instance, with small characters, $\verb|kern| = -2$ would cause the rightmost column
of one to overlap with the leftmost column of the next.

\section{File Handler Functions}
In the old version of podzilla, every file type and the means to handle it had to be hardcoded
into the file browser code. While that might work in a monolithic situation, it is certainly
not feasible in the case of \pzt, where both every file type and the file browser might be
modules! As such, \pzt\ has a few functions modules can use to let file browsers handle
their types.

Modules that handle a filetype may define one {\sl default action}, and zero or more {\sl
alternate actions}. The default action is the one performed when the file is selected
with the action button; alternate actions are displayed in a menu when the action button
is held on a file. Setting a default action is relatively easy: simply specify a predicate
to tell you whether the file satisfies the action, and a function to perform the action.

Setting an alternate action, on the other hand, is a bit more involved. You need to
create a {\it menu item} with its fields pre-filled out appropriately: name, flags,
{\sf makesub}. When your menu handler for that action is called, the file name
will be placed in the item's \verb|data| pointer.

To perform the default action for a file, you simply call \verb|pz_browser_open(file)|.
File browsers should hook this function for directories to open the browser to that
directory.

\section{Text Input}
\pzt\ also provides a few facilities for text input, though admittedly not much.
Text input methods are implemented as described in the TTK API. Modules implementing them
should call \verb|pz_register_input_method()| with a function that will create a new
TIM. Widgets that wish to use text input need simply call \verb|pz_start_input()|.
This system does not natively support text input widgets, multiple text input modules
loaded at once, etc.~but those things can be easily managed with modules. In fact, such
modules have already been written.

Two functions \verb|pz_register_input_method_n()| and \verb|pz_start_input_n()| act exactly
as stated above, except that they are intended for use when only numeric input is desired.

\section{Global Events}
Modules that wish to trap the holding of a certain button call \verb|pz_register_|\hskip0pt\verb|global_hold_button()|;
the handler for this event needs to call \verb|pz_handled_|\hskip0pt\verb|hold()|, or all hell will break loose. Similarly, modules can trap
otherwise unused buttons for their own use with \verb|pz_register_global_unused_button()|.

\section{Internationalization}
All modules should use \verb|_("this is a string")| for strings visible to the user; this
enables them to be localized for different languages. Since gettext does not handle
multiple localization files very well, {\bf modules need not provide their own translations}.
All translations for modules included in SVN, plus the core's, will be in one file.

For adding menu items, {\it do not} use \verb|_()| for the menu path; these strings are
translated in the menu widget itself, and are extracted specially.

\chapter{Function Reference}
Here's the documentation for all the functions in \pzt. If you aren't understanding
some aspect of the bigger picture, look in the previous chapter.

\section{Modules}
\begin{verbatim}
#define PZ_MOD_INIT(fn)
PzModule *pz_register_module (const char *name, void (*cleanup)());
const char *pz_module_get_cfgpath (PzModule *mod, const char *file);
const char *pz_module_get_datapath (PzModule *mod, const char *file);
void pz_module_iterate (void (*fn)(const char *name, const char *longname,
                                   const char *author));
void *pz_module_softdep (const char *module, const char *symbol);
\end{verbatim}
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt PZ_MOD_INIT}] declares the name of your module init function so that it is called
properly when the module is loaded. Its internal details are rather scary and
not for the faint of heart {\tt ;-)}
\item[{\tt pz_register_module}] is used to do two things: (1)~it returns a
\verb|PzModule*| used to access data and configuration; and (2)~it registers
a cleanup function to be called just before podzilla exits. If you don't need
the cleanup, pass \verb|NULL|; if you don't need the return value, ignore it.
You don't have to call this function.
\item[{\tt pz_module_get_cfgpath}] returns a path to the configuration file named
\verb|file| for the module whose handle is in \verb|mod|. This file will be somewhere
in the \verb|/etc/podzilla/modules| hierarchy, and can be written to.
\item[{\tt pz_module_get_datapath}] returns a path to a data file that was bundled
with the module; its arguments are the same as for \verb|pz_module_get_cfgpath()|.
However, data files may {\it not} be written to.
\item[{\tt pz_module_iterate}] is used to get information about loaded modules. It
calls \verb|fn| for each module loaded, passing the shortname in \verb|name|, the
display name in \verb|longname|, and the author in \verb|author|, all as marked in
the \verb|Module| file.
\item[{\tt pz_module_softdep}] is used to depend, maybe conditionally, on a function
or variable in another module without failing to load in the absence of that module.
\verb|module| is the shortname of the module you're looking for, and \verb|symbol|
is the name of the symbol ({\it without} a leading underscore, even on OS X).
\returns the address of the function or variable if it is found and its module is loaded, or
\verb|NULL| if not. You'll probably want to put the returned value into a pointer you save
(and check for \verb|NULL| before using).
\end{description}

\section{Configuration}
Configuration items are stored internally as \verb|PzConfItem*|s, and sometimes these
are returned. The structure is basically a fancy union, for the different types of item.

\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct _pz_ConfItem 
{
    unsigned int sid;

#define PZ_SETTING_INT     1
#define PZ_SETTING_STRING  2
#define PZ_SETTING_FLOAT   3
#define PZ_SETTING_ILIST   4
#define PZ_SETTING_SLIST   5
#define PZ_SETTING_BLOB    255
    int type;

    union 
    {
	int ival;
	char *strval;
	double fval;
	struct { int *ivals; int nivals; };
	struct { char **strvals; int nstrvals; };
	struct { void *blobval; int bloblen; };
    };
    struct _pz_ConfItem *next;
} PzConfItem;
\end{verbatim}
It should be used as follows.
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt sid}] indicates the setting ID of this setting; considering you just asked for it
by ID, this may not be the most useful piece of information {\tt :-)}
\item[{\tt type}] indicates the setting type, one of the \verb|PZ_SETTING_*| values.
\item[Integer settings] use \verb|ival| to store the int.
\item[String settings] use \verb|strval| to store the string.
\item[Float settings] use \verb|fval| to store the double.
\item[Intlist settings] use \verb|ivals| to store the integers, and \verb|nivals| indicates how
many there are.
\item[Stringlist settings] use \verb|strvals| as an array of strings, and \verb|nstrvals| tells you
how many there are. Also, the pointer after the last in \verb|strvals| is \verb|NULL|.
\item[Blob settings] use \verb|blobval| to store the data and \verb|bloblen| to store its length.
\end{description}

The functions for working with config files and settings are given below.

{\footnotesize\begin{verbatim}
PzConfig *pz_load_config (const char *filename);
void pz_save_config (PzConfig *conf);
void pz_blast_config (PzConfig *conf);
void pz_free_config (PzConfig *conf);
void pz_config_iterate (PzConfig *conf, void (*fn)(PzConfItem *));

PzConfItem *pz_get_setting (PzConfig *conf, unsigned int sid);
int pz_get_int_setting (PzConfig *conf, unsigned int sid);
const char *pz_get_string_setting (PzConfig *conf, unsigned int sid);

void pz_set_int_setting (PzConfig *conf, unsigned int sid, int val);
void pz_set_string_setting (PzConfig *conf, unsigned int sid, const char *val);
void pz_set_float_setting (PzConfig *conf, unsigned int sid, double val);
void pz_set_ilist_setting (PzConfig *conf, unsigned int sid, int *vals, int nval);
void pz_set_slist_setting (PzConfig *conf, unsigned int sid, char **vals, int nval);
void pz_set_blob_setting (PzConfig *conf, unsigned int sid, void *val, int bytes);

void pz_unset_setting (PzConfig *conf, unsigned int sid);
\end{verbatim}
}

No matter what, when a setting is asked for and not found, 0 or \verb|NULL| will be returned.
If you're setting the setting, you don't need to worry about its old value, type, or existence.

\begin{description}
\item[{\tt pz_load_config}] loads a configuration file from \verb|filename| and initializes a
corresponding \verb|PzConfig*| (an opaque type). The filename is saved in the \verb|PzConfig|
structure, so you need not save it yourself. If \verb|filename| does not exist, an empty
configuration is returned.
\item[{\tt pz_save_config}] saves the modified configuration \verb|conf| back to disk.
\item[{\tt pz_blast_config}] unsets all settings and then saves \verb|conf|.
\item[{\tt pz_free_config}] frees the in-memory data associated with \verb|conf|. It has
no effect on the data on disk.
\item[{\tt pz_config_iterate}] calls \verb|fn| for each setting in \verb|conf|.
\vskip6pt
\item[{\tt pz_get_setting}] returns the \verb|PzConfItem| associated with setting \verb|sid|,
or \verb|NULL| if \verb|sid| is not set. If you don't want to worry about dereferencing a structure,

\item[{\tt pz_get_int_setting}] returns the integer value of setting \verb|sid|, assuming it is set

\begin{description}
\item[{\tt pz_new_menu_window}] is a function pointer to the function that will
create the menu. By default, this is (surprise) \verb|pz_default_new_menu_window|.
The function will receive a normal TTK menu widget and is responsible for extracting
the items from it and displaying them however it sees fit. If it wants to change
the behavior of submenus as well, it should compare {\sf makesub}s to \verb|pz_mh_sub|
and insert its own submenu handling if they are equal.
\item[{\tt pz_get_menu_item}] returns the menu item to which \verb|menupath| refers, or
\verb|NULL| if it does not exist. This is useful for setting properties on the menu item
that do not have an analogue in podzilla.
\item[{\tt pz_mh_sub}] is the menu handler for podzilla menus, if you want it for comparison
purposes.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_add_legacy}] adds a menu item with a handler in the style of legacy podzilla.
It should not be used in new code.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_add_ttkh}] adds a menu item with a TTK-style menu handler, using the supplied
data pointer.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_add_stub}] adds an invisible do-nothing item at \verb|menupath| for the sole
purpose of making a future addition at that spot not be tacked onto the end of the menu.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_add_after}] adds a normal podzilla-style menu handler for \verb|menupath|.
However, if an item called \verb|after| (not a menu path, just the item name) exists in
the menu the handler is being added to, it will be added immediately after that item.
(If not, the usual semantics of adding on the end are taken.)
\item[{\tt pz_menu_add_top}] adds \verb|menupath| to the {\it top} of
its parent menu, instead of the bottom.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_add_action}] is the workhorse menu adder; it adds the normal podzilla-style
menu handler to the menu at \verb|menupath|. If there is nothing at \verb|menupath|, the item is
added to the bottom of its parent menu; otherwise, it replaces its namesake.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_add_option}] adds an item that allows the user to pick among a set of choices.
The \verb|choices| array should be terminated with a \verb|NULL| pointer.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_get_option}] returns the option selected by the user for \verb|menupath|,
as an index into \verb|choices|.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_set_option}] sets the option for \verb|menupath| to the index \verb|choices|
into the choices array.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_add_setting}] adds an item that allows a user to pick among a set of choices,
but instead of storing the choice it is used to modify setting \verb|sid| in configuration
\verb|conf|. \verb|choices| and \verb|menupath| have the same semantics as for \verb|pz_menu_add_option()|.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_sort}] sorts the menu pointed to by \verb|menupath| ASCIIbetically but case-insensitively.
\item[{\tt pz_menu_remove}] removes the menu or menu item pointed to by \verb|menupath| from the menu.

\begin{description}
\item[{\tt pz_do_window}] is the simple function. It creates a window called \verb|name|
and having geometry \verb|geometry| (one of \verb|PZ_WINDOW_|[\verb|NORMAL|, \verb|FULLSCREEN|, \verb|POPUP|]), then adds to it
the widget defined by handlers {\sf draw} and {\sf event}, then sets the timer
on that widget to tick every {\tt timer} milliseconds, then finalizes the window,
then returns it. Whew.
\item[{\tt pz_new_window}] creates a window having title \verb|name| and geometry \verb|geometry|.
If \verb|geometry| is \verb|PZ_WINDOW_XYWH|, you must in addition specify four more arguments:
the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the window's upper-left corner, and its width and height, in that order.
\item[{\tt pz_finish_window}] finalizes a window after having added all widgets to it; this is only
currently necessary for popup windows but should be used indiscriminately. \returns the window
argument, so it's easy to use in a line like \verb|return pz_finish_window(ret);|
\item[{\tt pz_add_widget}] adds the podzilla widget with handlers {\sf draw} and {\sf event}
to the window \verb|win|. \returns the widget, so you can do more things with it once it's
added (e.g.~set timers).
\item[{\tt pz_new_widget}] creates a widget, like \verb|pz_add_widget()| but without adding it
to any window. It can be later added with \verb|ttk_add_widget()|.
\item[{\tt pz_resize_widget}] changes the size of \verb|widget| to $\verb|w|\times\verb|h|$.
\item[{\tt pz_widget_set_timer}] is a synonym of the eponymous TTK function call: it sets
the timer for \verb|wid| to tick every \verb|ms| milliseconds.
\item[{\tt pz_hide_window}] gets \verb|win| offscreen but does not slate it to be freed; if it
was the result of a menu item, the same window will pop up again without any initialization
next time that item is selected.
\item[{\tt pz_close_window}] hides \verb|win| and in addition sets a flag so that it will be
freed and recreated from scratch next time its menu item is selected. (If the window was not
the result of a menu item, and you need it freed {\it right now}, use \verb|ttk_free_window|.)
\item[{\tt pz_show_window}] manually shows a previously hidden window.

void pz_header_set_local (TWidget *left, TWidget *right);
void pz_header_unset_local (void);
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[{\tt pz_hwid_put_left}] places \verb|wid| at the far left of the header, shoving
any already-packed widgets to the side. Because of some implementation quirks, it can only
be used in a module init function.
\item[{\tt pz_hwid_pack_left}] packs \verb|wid| as far left as it can in the header, but without
moving any already-packed widgets.
\item[{\tt pz_hwid_pack_right}] packs \verb|wid| as far right as it can in the header without moving
any already-packed widgets.
\item[{\tt pz_hwid_unpack}] removes \verb|wid| from the header. Other widgets are not moved to fill
the gap.
\item[{\tt pz_header_set_local}] changes the header widgets for one particular application.
If \verb|left| is not \verb|NULL|, all left-packed widgets are temporarily hidden and \verb|left|
is shown in their stead; the same is true for \verb|right| and right-packed widgets.
{\it Do not call \texttt{pz_header_set_local} twice} without an intervening \verb|pz_header_unset_local|;
things Won't Work Right$^{\rm TM}$.
\item[{\tt pz_header_unset_local}] restores the global header widgets to visibility and hides
and frees any local header widgets that had been set.

\section{Dialogs}
\begin{verbatim}
extern int (*pz_do_dialog) (const char *title, const char *text,
			    const char *b0, const char *b1, const char *b2,
			    int timeout, int is_err);

int pz_dialog (const char *title, const char *text,
	       int nbuttons, int timeout, ...);
int pz_errdialog (const char *title, const char *text,
		  int nbuttons, int timeout, ...);
void pz_message_title (const char *title, const char *text);
void pz_message (const char *text);
void pz_warning (const char *fmt, ...);
void pz_error (const char *fmt, ...);
void pz_perror (const char *firstpart);
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[{\tt pz_do_dialog}] is a function pointer you may redefine if you want to
change the appearance of dialogs. It is passed a \verb|title|, the \verb|text|
of the message, three buttons (\verb|b0| \verb|b1| \verb|b2|) some of which
may be \verb|NULL|, a \verb|timeout| in seconds which may be 0 (no timeout), and
a flag \verb|is_err| indicating whether the dialog is the result of an error.
It should show the dialog, start a sub-\verb|ttk_run()|, and return the result.
\item[{\tt pz_dialog}] is the function {\it you} should call to ask a question.
The \verb|title| and \verb|text| have obvious meanings. The dialog will have
\verb|nbuttons| buttons and, if $\verb|timeout| > 0$, will select the first
button automatically after \verb|timeout| seconds. The buttons' names
must be passed as \verb|nbuttons| arguments in the \verb|...|.
\item[{\tt pz_errdialog}] works exactly like \verb|pz_dialog()|, except it treats
the matter as an ``error''. This affects nothing but what color scheme properties
are used to display the dialog.
\item[{\tt pz_message_title}] displays a non-error dialog with the specified title and text, and
one button ``Ok''.
\item[{\tt pz_message}] displays the informational message \verb|text|. Use it to report
non-problems.
\item[{\tt pz_warning}] displays the ``Warning'' resulting from the provided \verb|printf()|
format string. The dialog is displayed like an error; only the title differs. Use it to
report recoverable problems.
\item[{\tt pz_error}] displays the ``Error'' resulting from the provided \verb|printf()| format
string. Use it to report errors that have consequences.
\item[{\tt pz_perror}] shows an error message consisting of \verb|firstpart|, a colon, space,
and the human-readable value of \verb|errno|. Use it to report errors opening a file or somesuch.

void pz_vector_string_center (ttk_surface srf, const char *string, int x,
                              int y, int cw, int ch, int kern, ttk_color col);
int pz_vector_width (const char *string, int cw, int ch, int kern);
\end{verbatim}
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt pz_vector_string}] draws the \verb|string| with color \verb|col| on \verb|srf| at $(x,y)$ using
characters of size $\verb|cw|\times\verb|ch|$ and adjusting kerning by \verb|kern| pixels. (Whew.)
\item[{\tt pz_vector_string_center}] works like \verb|pz_vector_string|, except that $(x,y)$ indicates
the {\it center} of the string, rather than the top-left corner.
\item[{\tt pz_vector_width}] returns the width of \verb|string| drawn with characters $\verb|cw|\times\verb|ch|$ and kerning adjustment of \verb|kern| pixels.
\end{description}

\section{iPod}

void pz_ipod_reboot(void);
void pz_ipod_powerdown(void);
int pz_ipod_usb_is_connected(void);
int pz_ipod_fw_is_connected(void);
\end{verbatim}
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_set}] sets $\verb|sid| = \verb|value|$ in the podzilla global configuration,
and also sets it immediately for the iPod.
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_fix_setting}] sets \verb|sid| to \verb|value| currently for the iPod, but without
storing it in \verb|pz_global_config|.
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_fix_settings}] does \verb|pz_ipod_fix_setting| for everything in \verb|conf|.
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_get_battery_level}] returns the level (between 0--512) of the iPod's battery.
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_is_charging}] returns 1 if the iPod is connected to power, 0 if not.
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_get_hw_version}] returns the iPod's hardware version as a hex number.
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_go_to_diskmode}] sends the iPod into diskmode immediately.
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_reboot}] uninitializes podzilla, then reboots the iPod.
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_powerdown}] uninitializes podzilla, then powers down the iPod. Press the action
button to power it back up.
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_usb_is_connected}] returns 1 if the iPod is connected to USB, 0 if not.
\item[{\tt pz_ipod_fw_is_connected}] returns 1 if the iPod is connected to FireWire, 0 if not.
\end{description}

\section{Fonts}
\begin{verbatim}
void pz_load_font (ttk_font *f, const char *default,
                   int setting, PzConfig *conf);
TWindow *pz_select_font (ttk_menu_item *item);
\end{verbatim}

These functions let you work with fonts user-friendlily.
To set the font, you put \verb|pz_select_font| as the menu handler
for some menu item. In that menu item, set \verb|data| to be a
{\it pointer} to the font to set, and \verb|cdata| the setting ID.
If you're modifying something in a module-local configuration (as
opposed to the global one), put the configuration in \verb|item->data2|.

Then, to load it, call \verb|pz_load_font|. Pass a {\it pointer}
to the \verb|ttk_font|, and a default value to use if the setting is not set;
the setting, and the configuration to take it from. The setting is stored
as a string, in the format \verb|Font Name,size|.

/* dsp open and close:  mode takes DSP_LINEIN, DSP_LINEOUT and DSP_MIC */
int pz_dsp_open(pz_dsp_st *oss, int mode);
void pz_dsp_close(pz_dsp_st *oss);

\section{Files}
\begin{verbatim}
TWindow *pz_browser_open (const char *path);
TWidget *pz_browser_get_actions (const char *path);
void pz_browser_set_handler (int (*pred)(const char *),
                             TWindow *(*handler)());
void pz_browser_remove_handler (int (*pred)(const char *));
void pz_browser_add_action (int (*pred)(const char *),
                            ttk_menu_item *action);
void pz_browser_remove_action (int (*pred)(const char *));
\end{verbatim}

All the handlers work with a {\sl predicate}; that is, a function that takes
a filename and returns an \verb|int|: 1 if it matches, 0 if not. The function
can examine the extension, open the file and check for a magic number, return
1 every third call but not on Tuesdays, whatever \texttt{:-)}

\begin{description}
\item[{\tt pz_browser_open}] returns the window created by the default action for the file
\verb|path|, or \verb|TTK_MENU_DONOTHING| if nothing matched.
\item[{\tt pz_browser_get_actions}] returns a menu widget of alternate actions for \verb|path|;
if you don't want them in a menu, you can extract the items and work with them.
\item[{\tt pz_browser_set_handler}] sets the default handler for files matching {\sf pred} to
be {\sf handler}. {\sf handler} should return a \verb|TWindow*| or one of the TTK menu directives.
\item[{\tt pz_browser_remove_handler}] removes the default handler for files matching {\sf pred}.
\item[{\tt pz_browser_add_action}] adds the alternate action represented by the menu item
\verb|action| for files matching {\sf pred}.
\item[{\tt pz_browser_remove_action}] removes the alternate action for files matching {\sf pred}.
\end{description}

\section{Input}
\begin{verbatim}
void pz_register_input_method (TWidget *(*handler)());
void pz_register_input_method_n (TWidget *(*handler)());
int pz_start_input();
int pz_start_input_n();
\end{verbatim}

If you are a widget wanting text input, call \verb|pz_start_input()| (or \verb|pz_|\hskip0pt\verb|start_|\hskip0pt\verb|input_n()|
if you want only numerical input). It returns the height of the TIM widget; you can then use
TTK input calls to mess with it further.

If you are a module providing text input, call \verb|pz_register_input_method()| and/or
\verb|pz_register_input_method_n()|, passing a function that will return a viable TIM widget.

\section{Global Events}
\begin{verbatim}
void pz_register_global_hold_button (unsigned char ch, int ms,
                                     void (*handler)());
void pz_register_global_unused_handler (unsigned char ch,
                                        int (*handler)(int, int));
void pz_unregister_global_hold_button (unsigned char ch);
void pz_unregister_global_unused_handler (unsigned char ch);
void pz_handled_hold (unsigned char ch);
\end{verbatim}

\verb|pz_register_global_hold_button()| sets up \verb|handler| to be called
whenever button \verb|ch| is held down for \verb|ms| milliseconds. This handler
{\bf must} call \verb|pz_handled_hold()| or Bad Things$^{\rm TM}$ will happen.
You can unregister the hold handler with \verb|pz_unregister_global_hold_button()|.

\verb|pz_register_global_unused_handler()| sets up \verb|handler| to be called
whenever the button \verb|ch| is released and the event is not handled.
\verb|pz_|\hskip0pt\verb|unregister_|\hskip0pt\verb|global_unused_handler()| removes this association.

\chapter{\texttt{Module} and \texttt{Config} Files and the Build System}
Here you'll find out about all the non-coding stuff related to making a build of \pzt\ tick.

\section{\texttt{Module} Files}\label{moddesc}
\verb|Module| files are files containing metadata that is used in loading modules and in managing
them host-side.
The metadata is a separate file instead of being embedded in the module itself because it contains information
that must be parsed before the module is even loaded---for instance, a module's dependencies
must be loaded before the module itself.

The format of the \verb|Module| file is one or more lines of the format \verb|Key: value|.
Here's a complete example.
\begin{verbatim}
Module: tidial
Display-name: Scroll Through & Dial Type
Description: A text input method that allows you to scroll \
  through a list of characters to select the one you want.
Category: Text Input
Author: Rebecca Bettencourt
Dependencies: textinput
\end{verbatim}
Comments are supported (they start with \verb|#|),
as are blank lines, but lines consisting solely of spaces will not work.
Case matters for the directives. (The continuation with \verb|\| above is used
only to prevent running the text off the edge of the page; in the file, the
value should be all on one line.)

Here are all the recognized directives:
\begin{description}
\item[Module:] The short name of the module. Remember, this should be all lowercase letters, and
it must be {\it unique}.
\item[Display-name:] The long/display name of the module.
\item[Description:] A one-line description of the module's function. Used by the configuration
system.
\item[Category:] The ``category'' the module should be displayed in in the configuration system.
For subcategories, use \verb|/|; for example, \verb|Games/Strategy|. If you have a \verb|Config|
file, this line is ignored.
\item[Author:] The author; if this is omitted the author will be listed as ``Anonymous.''
\item[Signature:] A signature for the past three fields, intended to be used in the future to verify
uniqueness of name. Not implemented yet.
\item[Dependencies:] A space-, comma-, semicolon-, or colon-separated list of module dependencies.
Use commas unless you have a really good reason not to.
\item[Provides:] Used by modules exporting an API; only one module of many that ``Provide'' the same thing
may be loaded at once. Not implemented yet.
\item[Unstable:] If the module is unstable, give a reason, e.g. ``does not work'' or ``crashes
randomly.''
\end{description}
Any unrecognized directives will be warned about.

\section{\texttt{Config} Files}
\verb|Config| files give information about compile-time configuration options that
can be selected by the user. They are in the exact same format used by the Linux kernel
and uClibc configuration systems, mainly because the configuration program is nearly the
same too. {\it You don't need a Config file unless you need to specify compile-time configuration options.
Most modules don't.}

The file is composed of a set of directives, one per line. Each directive can have arguments.
A {\it partial} list of the recognized directives is below; for a full list, see
\verb|Kconfig/|\discretionary{}{}{}\verb|Kconfig|-\discretionary{}{}{}\verb|language.txt| in
the \pzt\ source tree.

\begin{description}
\item[{\tt menu}] specifies the start of a submenu, which should probably have configuration directives
(\verb|config|) inside it. It takes one argument, a quoted name for the menu. The menu ends with an 
\verb|endmenu| directive. The \pzt\ build system does some trickery behind the scenes so that
multiple \verb|menu| sections referring ultimately to the same menu get amalgamated together, so your
file will probably start with \verb|menu "Games"| or something.
\item[{\tt config}] specifies the start of a configuration directive---something you want to be
configurable. It has one argument, the name of the configuration directive, which must be
a valid identifier. A directive named \verb|MODULE_shortname| where \verb|shortname| is the
shortname of your module determines whether your module is to be compiled in, made as a module,
or not compiled at all. A configuration directive ends at the next \verb|config| or \verb|endmenu|
directive; it is customary to indent the lines that are ``under'' the directive, like \verb|bool|
and \verb|default|.
\item[{\tt bool}] specifies that this is a ``yes or no'' symbol. It needs no arguments, but it can take
one to use as a \verb|prompt| (see below).
\item[{\tt tristate}] specifies that this is a symbol that can be one of \verb|y|, \verb|m|, or \verb|n|;
that is, compiled in statically, compiled as a module, or not compiled. You'll probably only use
this for the config option determining whether your module is built at all.
\item[{\tt string}] specifies that this is a symbol that should be a user-enterable string. Like
the other type definitions, it can take a \verb|prompt| argument as its own arg. (See below.)
\item[{\tt integer} and {\tt hex}] allow the user to enter those specific types of values.
\item[{\tt prompt}] takes one argument---the user-visible prompt for the parameter; for example,
``Use the new high-efficiency frobulator (UNSTABLE)''. The argument should be enclosed in quotes.
Optionally, you can put the prompt argument after one of the past few type declarations; for instance,
\verb|bool "Do foo"|.
\item[{\tt default}] specifies the default value for this parameter. For a bool, this can be
\verb|y| or \verb|n| (without quotes); for a tristate, \verb|y| or \verb|m| or \verb|n|; for
a string, a string in quotes; for an integer, an integer. If you don't specify one, something
sensible will be used.
\item[{\tt depends on} or {\tt requires}] indicates another option that must be selected for
this one to become visible.
\item[{\tt select}] is a reverse dependency---if you select this one, that one will get set too.
\item[{\tt help}] has no arguments, but it indicates the start of the help. The help follows, on
as many lines as you want. \emph{Each must be indented by a fixed amount}; the help ends with the first
line that isn't indented by at least this amount.
\end{description}

An overly complex example:
\begin{verbatim}
menu "Games"
menu "Classic"
config MODULE_blackjack
    tristate "Blackjack"
    default m
    help
      A blackjack module. You can set options in the "Blackjack
      Options" menu.

menu "Blackjack Options"
    depends on MODULE_blackjack

config BLACKJACK_ALLOW_CHEATING
    bool "Allow cheating"
    default n
    help
      Allow cheating with a special key sequence. Blah blah blah.

config BLACKJACK_VALUE
    integer "Value you have to get to win"
    default 21
    range 1 100
    help
      The value your cards must sum to in order for you to win.
      Of course, if you change this, it won't really be blackjack
      anymore...

endmenu
endmenu
endmenu
\end{verbatim}

\section{Build System}
A module Makefile looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
obj-m := mymodule.o
MODULE = mymodule
DATA = message.txt image.png
\end{verbatim}

The list of object files is specified by assigning to a variable called either
\verb|obj-y| or \verb|obj-m|, depending on whether the module should be compiled in statically
(\verb|y|) or made as a \verb|m|odule. (You could also, I guess, assign to \verb|obj-n| for
things that should \verb|n|ot be compiled, but it's just as easy to simply leave out said objects.)
If the module is in the podzilla source tree and connected to the configuration system, you
should do something like
\begin{verbatim}
obj-$(CONFIG_MYMODULE) := mymodule.o
\end{verbatim}
\begin{comment}
$ Let's appease XEmacs!
\end{comment}

\subsection{Compiling it}
To compile the module, you have two choices: place it in the podzilla tree, or compile it
from outside. Which one you choose really doesn't matter.

{\bf Compiling inside the \pz\ tree.} Copy a folder containing the stuff for your module
into \<path to podzilla>\verb|/modules/|. {\sl The directory must have the same name
as the module shortname.} Then, go to the root of the podzilla tree and type your normal
\verb|make| command; everything should Just Work$^{\rm TM}$.

{\bf Compiling outside the tree.} When in your module folder, type
\begin{verbatim}
make -C /path/to/podzilla/directory SUBDIRS=`pwd` [IPOD=1]
\end{verbatim}
and your module will be built (the output file will be called {\tt \$(MODULE).o} for the iPod or
{\tt \$(MODULE).so} for the desktop). An {\tt xpod} folder and a {\tt pod} file will {\bf not} be
created---you'll have to do that yourself.
