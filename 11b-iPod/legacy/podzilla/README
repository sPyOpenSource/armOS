Build Instructions
------------------

podzilla can be built to run on the iPod or on your host computer.  You should
reference http://www.ipodlinux.org/Building_Podzilla for instructions.

Some features can be enabled/disabled by setting environmental varables:

    * IPOD   - If set compile for the iPod. Otherwise compile for host.
        o MINI  - On host compile for a 138x110 2bpp screen.
        o PHOTO - On host compile for a 220x176 16bpp screen.
    * LOCALE - If set compile in gettext locale support.
    * MIKMOD - If set compile in mikmod support.
    * MPDC   - If set compile in MPD client rather than audio support for MP3,
               and AAC.  See musicpd.org and www.ipodlinux.org/MPD for more
               information.

You can specify these variables on the command line, like so:
% make IPOD=1 LOCALE=1 MIKMOD=1 MPDC=1
