iPodEth1394
===========

This is an ipodlinux compatible ethernet-over-firewire driver for the 2.6
kernel series. The driver should work on 2.6.4-rc1 and newer and also on some
older mm kernels (but should work with minor tweaks on about any quite recent 
2.6).

You might not want to load this module with eth1394 loaded - they might easily
clash - I haven't tested that.

This driver is NOT SMP-safe, it will lock up a multiprocessor machine! Neither
is it compatible with a preemptible kernel (CONFIG_PREEMPT)! If you can fix 
this, please mail us to the ipodlinux-devel list.

Compiling:
----------

Simply do "make" if you're compiling for the current kernel and have the
sources where the kernel was built. Otherwise do "make KDIR=/kernel/source" if
you want to build for the kernel in /kernel/source.
